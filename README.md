# Binary Classification Problem using Neural Networks and KNN Algorithm
Supervised machine learning technique uses algorithms to learn a function by taking labelled inputs from data and uses the patterns learned to produce output when new data or unseen data is introduced.  (Harrison, 2018).
The primary objectives of this analysis is to use two supervised machine learning classification techniques (Kneighborsclassifier and Neural Networks) to predict the presence of diabetes in the sample.  The performances of these models will be evaluated using different metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall and confusion matrix to identify which model performs better as well as experimenting other prep-processing steps that can improve the model. Thereafter the use of Microsoft azure will be implemented on the same data using different models. Based on the outcomes of the results, recommendations and conclusions will be drawn.
